			Today I'll take you on a journey through my everyday life as an IT intern in the bustling city of Makati, Manila. Join me as I share the ups and downs, challenges, and rewarding experiences of working in the heart of the Philippines' business district. From early mornings to late evenings, let's dive into the rhythm of my daily routine.

7:30 AM - The Start of the Day:
The alarm goes off, and I rise from my bed, ready to tackle another day as an IT intern. In Makati, time is precious, so I quickly get dressed, grab my bag, and head out of the apartment. Breakfast is often skipped due to time constraints, but a cup of hot coffee fuels my energy as I brace myself for the day ahead.

8:00 AM - Arrival at the Office:
I arrive at the office just in time, blending in with the bustling crowd of professionals making their way to work. Makati's skyline stands tall, an impressive sight that never fails to inspire me. Once inside, I greet my fellow interns and colleagues, and the hum of keyboards and discussions fill the air.

8:15 AM to 12:00 PM - Learning and Assisting:
As an intern, my days are filled with opportunities for growth and learning. I dive into various projects and tasks assigned to me, ranging from troubleshooting technical issues to assisting the IT team with software installations and updates. I often find myself researching new technologies and exploring innovative solutions to support the company's operations.

During this time, I have the chance to collaborate with experienced professionals who generously share their knowledge and guidance. The office environment is dynamic and fast-paced, demanding both adaptability and quick thinking. Despite the occasional challenges, I find immense satisfaction in contributing to the team's success.

Whether I opt for a quick bite at a nearby food stall or enjoy a sit-down meal at a cozy restaurant, this time allows me to recharge and connect with colleagues over delicious food and conversations.

1:00 PM to 5:00 PM - Afternoon Engagements:
The afternoon hours are typically filled with various engagements, such as attending team meetings, working on individual projects, and collaborating with different departments within the organization. Makati's IT industry is diverse, and it's a privilege to be exposed to a wide range of technologies and domains during my internship.
